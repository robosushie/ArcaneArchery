# Arcane Archery

"Arcane Archery" is a virtual reality (VR) game that combines traditional archery mechanics with enchanting magical elements. Players wield a magical bow and arrow in an immersive XR environment. This prototype aims to add layers of surrealism and magic, to transform the traditional bow and arrow gameplay mechanics into a mesmerizing experience.
This project is part of my Week 1 of **XR Bootcamp Prototyping Course**

## Features

### Core Features

- **Two-handed Bow and Arrow Mechanics:** Use VR controllers to simulate holding and drawing a bow with realistic tension and release mechanics. Instead of grabbing and picking up the bow, a dissolve shader is used to make the bow appear and disappear.

- **Voice-based Commands for Magic Spells and Enchantments:** Integrated Voice SDK and Wit.ai to switch between magical elements using the right-hand trigger press and voice commands such as "Fire Spell", "Lightning Spell", etc.

- **Magical Arrow VFX:** Arrows can be enchanted with various magical effects such as fire, lightning, water splash, etc.

- **Arrow Physics:** Realistic physics system for arrows, taking into account factors such as gravity, drag, and wind.

- **Target System:** Static targets with circular marks provide visual and audio feedback when hit, including special effects for different magical arrow types.

### Stretch Goals

- **Modern Inventory UI for Storing Arrows:** A sleek and modern-style quiver/inventory system for storing arrows, with new interactions for swapping arrows.

- **Advanced Magical Effects:** Complex effects such as arrow splitting into multiple projectiles, arrows that make vines grow on the target upon impact, time reversal, etc.

- **Enemies and Game Environment:** Survival gameplay with aliens or flying creatures that attack the player (fly towards you).

- **Teleportation Arrows:** Special arrows that teleport/jump/move the player to a new location.
